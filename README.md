# Comment-Toxicity-Detection
This project is to develop a deep learning-based comment toxicity model using Python. Explore Deep learning models such as LSTM, CNN to analyze user comments and predict the likelihood of each comment being toxic which helps to take appropriate actions to mitigate the negative impact of toxic behavior.

### Problem Statement:
Online communities and social media platforms have become integral parts of modern communication, facilitating interactions and discussions on various topics. However, the prevalence of toxic comments, which include harassment, hate speech, and offensive language, poses significant challenges to maintaining healthy and constructive online discourse. To address this issue, there is a pressing need for automated systems capable of detecting and flagging toxic comments in real-time.
### Business Use Cases:
1.	Social Media Platforms: Social media platforms can utilize the developed comment toxicity model to automatically detect and filter out toxic comments in real-time.
2.	Online Forums and Communities: Forums and community websites can integrate the toxicity detection model to moderate user-generated content efficiently.
3.	Content Moderation Services: Companies offering content moderation services for online platforms can leverage the developed model to enhance their moderation capabilities.
4.	Brand Safety and Reputation Management: Brands and advertisers can use the toxicity detection model to ensure that their advertisements and sponsored content appear in safe and appropriate online environments.
5.	E-learning Platforms and Educational Websites: E-learning platforms and educational websites can employ the toxicity detection model to create safer online learning environments for students and educators.
6.	News Websites and Media Outlets: News websites and media outlets can utilize the toxicity detection model to moderate user comments on articles and posts.

### Approach:
1.	Data Exploration and Preparation:
    - Load and explore the dataset.
    - Perform text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization).
2.	Model Development:
    - Train a deep learning model for toxicity detection.
    - Experiment with architectures like LSTMs, CNNs, or transformer-based models (BERT).
    - Store the trained model for deployment.
3.	Streamlit Application Development:
    - Build an interactive UI using Streamlit to allow users to enter comments and receive toxicity predictions in real-time.
    - Display data insights, model performance metrics, and sample test cases in the Streamlit dashboard.
    - Provide options to upload a CSV file for bulk predictions.
