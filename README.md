# Comment-Toxicity-Detection
This project is to develop a deep learning-based comment toxicity model using Python. Develop LSTM, CNN &amp; BERT models to analyze user comments and predict the likelihood of each comment being toxic which helps to take appropriate actions to mitigate the negative impact of toxic behavior.
